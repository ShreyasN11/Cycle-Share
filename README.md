Cycle Share is a community-driven platform that promotes fitness, affordability, and eco-friendly travel by enabling users to **rent cycles for city travel** or **list their own cycles for others to rent**. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Shadcn UI components for a clean, modern experience.
